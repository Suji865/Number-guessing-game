# Number-guessing-game
Introduction:

    This project is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. 
    The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. 
    The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too low or too high until the correct number is guessed.

Prerequisites:
           
           *Basic understanding of Python programming.
           *Familiarity with loops, conditional statements, and user input.


Learning Objectives:
           *Learn how to use the random module to generate random numbers.
           *Understand how to take user input and provide interactive feedback.
           *Develop a simple command-line game in Python.
